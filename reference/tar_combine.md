# Static aggregation

Aggregate the results of upstream targets into a new target.

`tar_combine()` expects unevaluated expressions for the `name`, and
`command` arguments, whereas `tar_combine_raw()` uses a character string
for `name` and an evaluated expression object for `command`. See the
examples for details.

## Usage

``` r
tar_combine(
  name,
  ...,
  command = vctrs::vec_c(!!!.x),
  use_names = TRUE,
  pattern = NULL,
  packages = targets::tar_option_get("packages"),
  library = targets::tar_option_get("library"),
  format = targets::tar_option_get("format"),
  repository = targets::tar_option_get("repository"),
  iteration = targets::tar_option_get("iteration"),
  error = targets::tar_option_get("error"),
  memory = targets::tar_option_get("memory"),
  garbage_collection = targets::tar_option_get("garbage_collection"),
  deployment = targets::tar_option_get("deployment"),
  priority = targets::tar_option_get("priority"),
  resources = targets::tar_option_get("resources"),
  storage = targets::tar_option_get("storage"),
  retrieval = targets::tar_option_get("retrieval"),
  cue = targets::tar_option_get("cue"),
  description = targets::tar_option_get("description")
)

tar_combine_raw(
  name,
  ...,
  command = expression(vctrs::vec_c(!!!.x)),
  use_names = TRUE,
  pattern = NULL,
  packages = targets::tar_option_get("packages"),
  library = targets::tar_option_get("library"),
  format = targets::tar_option_get("format"),
  repository = targets::tar_option_get("repository"),
  iteration = targets::tar_option_get("iteration"),
  error = targets::tar_option_get("error"),
  memory = targets::tar_option_get("memory"),
  garbage_collection = targets::tar_option_get("garbage_collection"),
  deployment = targets::tar_option_get("deployment"),
  priority = targets::tar_option_get("priority"),
  resources = targets::tar_option_get("resources"),
  storage = targets::tar_option_get("storage"),
  retrieval = targets::tar_option_get("retrieval"),
  cue = targets::tar_option_get("cue"),
  description = targets::tar_option_get("description")
)
```

## Arguments

- name:

  Name of the new target. `tar_combine()` expects unevaluated
  expressions for the `name`, and `command` arguments, whereas
  `tar_combine_raw()` uses a character string for `name` and an
  evaluated expression object for `command`. See the examples for
  details.

- ...:

  One or more target definition objects or list of target definition
  objects. Lists can be arbitrarily nested, as in
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

- command:

  R command to aggregate the targets. Must contain `!!!.x` where the
  arguments are to be inserted, where `!!!` is the unquote splice
  operator from `rlang`.

  `tar_combine()` expects unevaluated expressions for the `name`, and
  `command` arguments, whereas `tar_combine_raw()` uses a character
  string for `name` and an evaluated expression object for `command`.
  See the examples for details.

- use_names:

  Logical, whether to insert the names of the targets into the command
  when splicing.

- pattern:

  Code to define a dynamic branching branching for a target. In
  [`tar_target()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_target.html),
  `pattern` is an unevaluated expression, e.g.
  `tar_target(pattern = map(data))`. In
  [`tar_target_raw()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_target.html),
  `command` is an evaluated expression, e.g.
  `tar_target_raw(pattern = quote(map(data)))`.

  To demonstrate dynamic branching patterns, suppose we have a pipeline
  with numeric vector targets `x` and `y`. Then,
  `tar_target(z, x + y, pattern = map(x, y))` implicitly defines
  branches of `z` that each compute `x[1] + y[1]`, `x[2] + y[2]`, and so
  on. See the user manual for details.

- packages:

  Character vector of packages to load right before the target runs or
  the output data is reloaded for downstream targets. Use
  [`tar_option_set()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_option_set.html)
  to set packages globally for all subsequent targets you define.

- library:

  Character vector of library paths to try when loading `packages`.

- format:

  Optional storage format for the target's return value. With the
  exception of `format = "file"`, each target gets a file in
  `_targets/objects`, and each format is a different way to save and
  load this file. See the "Storage formats" section for a detailed list
  of possible data storage formats.

- repository:

  Character of length 1, remote repository for target storage. Choices:

  - `"local"`: file system of the local machine.

  - `"aws"`: Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket. Can be configured with
    a non-AWS S3 bucket using the `endpoint` argument of
    [`tar_resources_aws()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_resources_aws.html),
    but versioning capabilities may be lost in doing so. See the cloud
    storage section of <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/data.html>
    for details for instructions.

  - `"gcp"`: Google Cloud Platform storage bucket. See the cloud storage
    section of <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/data.html> for
    details for instructions.

  - A character string from
    [`tar_repository_cas()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_repository_cas.html)
    for content-addressable storage.

  Note: if `repository` is not `"local"` and `format` is `"file"` then
  the target should create a single output file. That output file is
  uploaded to the cloud and tracked for changes where it exists in the
  cloud. As of `targets` version 1.11.0 and higher, the local file is no
  longer deleted after the target runs.

- iteration:

  Character of length 1, name of the iteration mode of the target.
  Choices:

  - `"vector"`: branching happens with
    [`vctrs::vec_slice()`](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/reference/vec_slice.html)
    and aggregation happens with
    [`vctrs::vec_c()`](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/reference/vec_c.html).

  - `"list"`, branching happens with `[[]]` and aggregation happens with
    [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

  - `"group"`:
    [`dplyr::group_by()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html)-like
    functionality to branch over subsets of a non-dynamic data frame.
    For `iteration = "group"`, the target must not by dynamic (the
    `pattern` argument of
    [`tar_target()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_target.html)
    must be left `NULL`). The target's return value must be a data frame
    with a special `tar_group` column of consecutive integers from 1
    through the number of groups. Each integer designates a group, and a
    branch is created for each collection of rows in a group. See the
    [`tar_group()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_group.html)
    function to see how you can create the special `tar_group` column
    with
    [`dplyr::group_by()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html).

- error:

  Character of length 1, what to do if the target stops and throws an
  error. Options:

  - `"stop"`: the whole pipeline stops and throws an error.

  - `"continue"`: the whole pipeline keeps going.

  - `"null"`: The errored target continues and returns `NULL`. The data
    hash is deliberately wrong so the target is not up to date for the
    next run of the pipeline. In addition, as of `targets` version
    1.8.0.9011, a value of `NULL` is given to upstream dependencies with
    `error = "null"` if loading fails.

  - `"abridge"`: any currently running targets keep running, but no new
    targets launch after that.

  - `"trim"`: all currently running targets stay running. A queued
    target is allowed to start if:

    1.  It is not downstream of the error, and

    2.  It is not a sibling branch from the same
        [`tar_target()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_target.html)
        call (if the error happened in a dynamic branch).

    The idea is to avoid starting any new work that the immediate error
    impacts. `error = "trim"` is just like `error = "abridge"`, but it
    allows potentially healthy regions of the dependency graph to begin
    running. (Visit <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/debugging.html>
    to learn how to debug targets using saved workspaces.)

- memory:

  Character of length 1, memory strategy. Possible values:

  - `"auto"` (default): equivalent to `memory = "transient"` in almost
    all cases. But to avoid superfluous reads from disk,
    `memory = "auto"` is equivalent to `memory = "persistent"` for for
    non-dynamically-branched targets that other targets dynamically
    branch over. For example: if your pipeline has
    `tar_target(name = y, command = x, pattern = map(x))`, then
    `tar_target(name = x, command = f(), memory = "auto")` will use
    persistent memory for `x` in order to avoid rereading all of `x` for
    every branch of `y`.

  - `"transient"`: the target gets unloaded after every new target
    completes. Either way, the target gets automatically loaded into
    memory whenever another target needs the value.

  - `"persistent"`: the target stays in memory until the end of the
    pipeline (unless `storage` is `"worker"`, in which case `targets`
    unloads the value from memory right after storing it in order to
    avoid sending copious data over a network).

  For cloud-based file targets (e.g. `format = "file"` with
  `repository = "aws"`), the `memory` option applies to the temporary
  local copy of the file: `"persistent"` means it remains until the end
  of the pipeline and is then deleted, and `"transient"` means it gets
  deleted as soon as possible. The former conserves bandwidth, and the
  latter conserves local storage.

- garbage_collection:

  Logical: `TRUE` to run [`base::gc()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/gc.html)
  just before the target runs, in whatever R process it is about to run
  (which could be a parallel worker). `FALSE` to omit garbage
  collection. Numeric values get converted to `FALSE`. The
  `garbage_collection` option in
  [`tar_option_set()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_option_set.html)
  is independent of the argument of the same name in
  [`tar_target()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_target.html).

- deployment:

  Character of length 1. If `deployment` is `"main"`, then the target
  will run on the central controlling R process. Otherwise, if
  `deployment` is `"worker"` and you set up the pipeline with
  distributed/parallel computing, then the target runs on a parallel
  worker. For more on distributed/parallel computing in `targets`,
  please visit <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/crew.html>.

- priority:

  Deprecated on 2025-04-08 (`targets` version 1.10.1.9013). `targets`
  has moved to a more efficient scheduling algorithm
  (<https://github.com/ropensci/targets/issues/1458>) which cannot
  support priorities. The `priority` argument of
  [`tar_target()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_target.html)
  no longer has a reliable effect on execution order.

- resources:

  Object returned by
  [`tar_resources()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_resources.html)
  with optional settings for high-performance computing functionality,
  alternative data storage formats, and other optional capabilities of
  `targets`. See
  [`tar_resources()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_resources.html)
  for details.

- storage:

  Character string to control when the output of the target is saved to
  storage. Only relevant when using `targets` with parallel workers
  (<https://books.ropensci.org/targets/crew.html>). Must be one of the
  following values:

  - `"worker"` (default): the worker saves/uploads the value.

  - `"main"`: the target's return value is sent back to the host machine
    and saved/uploaded locally.

  - `"none"`: `targets` makes no attempt to save the result of the
    target to storage in the location where `targets` expects it to be.
    Saving to storage is the responsibility of the user. Use with
    caution.

- retrieval:

  Character string to control when the current target loads its
  dependencies into memory before running. (Here, a "dependency" is
  another target upstream that the current one depends on.) Only
  relevant when using `targets` with parallel workers
  (<https://books.ropensci.org/targets/crew.html>). Must be one of the
  following values:

  - `"auto"` (default): equivalent to `retrieval = "worker"` in almost
    all cases. But to avoid unnecessary reads from disk,
    `retrieval = "auto"` is equivalent to `retrieval = "main"` for
    dynamic branches that branch over non-dynamic targets. For example:
    if your pipeline has `tar_target(x, command = f())`, then
    `tar_target(y, command = x, pattern = map(x), retrieval = "auto")`
    will use `"main"` retrieval in order to avoid rereading all of `x`
    for every branch of `y`.

  - `"worker"`: the worker loads the target's dependencies.

  - `"main"`: the target's dependencies are loaded on the host machine
    and sent to the worker before the target runs.

  - `"none"`: `targets` makes no attempt to load its dependencies. With
    `retrieval = "none"`, loading dependencies is the responsibility of
    the user. Use with caution.

- cue:

  An optional object from
  [`tar_cue()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_cue.html)
  to customize the rules that decide whether the target is up to date.

- description:

  Character of length 1, a custom free-form human-readable text
  description of the target. Descriptions appear as target labels in
  functions like
  [`tar_manifest()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_manifest.html)
  and
  [`tar_visnetwork()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_visnetwork.html),
  and they let you select subsets of targets for the `names` argument of
  functions like
  [`tar_make()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_make.html).
  For example,
  `tar_manifest(names = tar_described_as(starts_with("survival model")))`
  lists all the targets whose descriptions start with the character
  string `"survival model"`.

## Value

A new target definition object to combine the return values from the
upstream targets. See the "Target definition objects" section for
background.

## Target definition objects

Most `tarchetypes` functions are target factories, which means they
return target definition objects or lists of target definition objects.
target definition objects represent skippable steps of the analysis
pipeline as described at <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/>. Please
read the walkthrough at
<https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html> to understand the
role of target definition objects in analysis pipelines.

For developers,
<https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/contributing.html#target-factories>
explains target factories (functions like this one which generate
targets) and the design specification at
<https://books.ropensci.org/targets-design/> details the structure and
composition of target definition objects.
